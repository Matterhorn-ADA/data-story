## Emotions in Conlicts

In our data story we explore conflicts all over the world and the public attention they receive. We harness the huge GDELT 2.0 dataset consisting of events collected every day from thousands media channels of the world's news. The GDELT contains various features about the particular events including the sentiment analysis of the news sources. We focus mostly on the emotions conflicts tend to arouse with respect to their distinct features. The questions we ask are whether some regions are payed more attention than others, if news articles get more emotionally involved in conflicts occuring closer to our homes, or whether we tend to depict particular regions, nations or ethnicities by some steady emotional patterns. Throughout our research we hope to lift the shroud of how equally media report on the worlds conflicts and whether some sentiment bias exists. As the public is nowadays heavily influenced by (social) media and emotions affect us often heavier than the pure facts, we believe it is an important task to investigate how our news sources work with such a power they have upon us.
